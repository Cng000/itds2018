##### Description
This course consists of a survey of analytical tools and concepts in data science, with goal of equipping students with an understanding of the best practices used by professional data scientists and analysts in top companies in technology, finance, and media. The course begins with an overview of fundamentals in data handling and exploratory data analysis, followed by an introduction to core concepts in statistical modeling and machine learning, and concludes with a brief introduction advanced concepts in data science.

Students will work with a wide variety of real world data sets throughout the course in order to gain hands on experience. Emphasis will be placed on frequent practice through writing and reviewing code each week. In addition, students will be assigned and expected to discuss short reading assignments ranging from academic reviews of popular topics in analytics as well as data science and engineering blog posts from companies such as Airbnb, Facebook, and Spotify. Tasks and readings will aim to demystify the work of data teams in the real world, and familiarize students with the concepts and resources needed to secure and succeed in analytical roles.

##### Pre-requisites
Intro to Programming (CSc102/103) or equivalent and Probability and Statistics (CSc217). The course assumes profiency in basic programming paradigms, data structures, and statiscal concepts. Students will also need a basic profiency in the _Python_ computing language to be acquired independently in the early weeks of the course.

### Course Objectives

##### Through this course, students should be able to:
1.	Explain the key steps in a data science project.
2.	Apply Python to load, clean, and process data sets.
3.	Identify key elements of and patterns in a data set using computational analysis and statistical methods.
4.	Explain and visualize empirical findings using with Python and other resources.
5.	Explain fundamental principles of machine learning.
6.	Apply predictive algorithms to a data set.
7.	Work effectively in a team dedicated to analyzing data.
